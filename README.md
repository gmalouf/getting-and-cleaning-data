## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project Submission

My solution to the [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-009) course project can be found here.  The purpose of the project was to demonstrate our ability to leverage the techniques taught in the course on a 'real world' data set.  

## File Index

* run_analysis.R - Script that retrieves the source data and performs the necessary transformations to produce our tidy data set 
* CodeBook.md - File that describes the output produced by run_analysis.R including an overview of the features from which the data set was derived from.
* README.md - The file you are reading now
